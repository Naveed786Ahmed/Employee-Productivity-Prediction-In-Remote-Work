ðŸ“± Employee Productivity Prediction in Remote Work

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This Flutter application predicts employee productivity in a remote work setting. Developed as part of my Web and Mobile Applications coursework, the app provides a simple, user-friendly interface for employees to input key metrics and view their productivity score.</p>

<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Real-Time Productivity Prediction: Enter details like weekly working hours, expected tasks, completed tasks, task complexity, and break duration to predict productivity.</li>
  <li>User-Friendly Design: The app has a clean, professional layout for easy navigation and input.</li>
  <li>Input Validation: Each input field includes validation to ensure accuracy and reliability.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Input Fields</h4>
<p>The productivity prediction is based on the following user inputs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Employee ID</li>
<li>Weekly Working Hours (Range: 35â€“55 hours)</li>
<li>Expected Tasks (Range: 10â€“15 tasks)</li>
<li>Tasks Completed (Range: 6â€“15 tasks)</li>
<li>Task Completion Rate (Range: 0.4â€“1)</li>
<li>Task Complexity (Range: 1â€“3)</li>
<li>Communication Frequency (Email) (Range: 10â€“30)</li>
<li>Communication Frequency (Meeting) (Range: 2â€“8)</li>
<li>Break Duration (Fixed: 7.5 hours)</li>
<li>Adjusted Task Completion</li>
</ol>

<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>Once all the fields are filled in, the app calculates a productivity score based on the entered values. The result is displayed after a brief processing message, helping employees get quick insights into their performance.</p>
